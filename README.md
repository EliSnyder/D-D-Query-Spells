# D-D-Query-Spells

This program is not meant to keep track of your character casting level, class, or even known spells. Instead, it is meant to be a quick reference for D&D 5e spells.

To run the program in cmd(Windows) or terminal(Mac/Linux) run the following command after installing Python and downloading the included csv file to the same directory as the python program: python querySpells.py.

The options that are currently available include:

List all spells
Learn about a spell
List spells by level
List spells by range
Search spells by keyword
Search spells using regex

Any suggestions will be taken into consideration and possibly added.
